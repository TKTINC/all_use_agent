# ALL-USE Agent Workstreams and Phases

This document outlines the workstreams and phases for implementing the ALL-USE Agent using the agent-oriented iAI framework. Each workstream represents a major functional area, and each phase represents a discrete implementation step within that workstream.

## Workstream 6: Collaboration and Integration

**Objective:** Develop the agent's ability to collaborate with humans and other agents, and integrate with external systems.

### Phase 1: Human-Agent Collaboration
- Implement explainable AI capabilities
- Create trust-building communication
- Develop collaborative decision frameworks
- Build preference learning
- Implement adaptive interaction styles

### Phase 2: Agent-Agent Collaboration

### Phase 3: External System Integration
- Implement reporting system integration
- Create data export capabilities
- Develop API services for external consumption
- Build notification systems
- Implement compliance and audit trail integration

## Implementation Approach

Each phase will follow the closed-loop documentation approach:

1. **Implementation Prompt**: Detailed requirements and specifications
2. **Implementation**: Code development based on the prompt
3. **Implementation Response**: Documentation of what was implemented, challenges, and future enhancements
4. **Review and Feedback**: Iterative improvement based on feedback

Phases will be implemented sequentially within each workstream, with dependencies managed across workstreams. The core Agent Foundation workstream will be completed first to establish the fundamental agent capabilities before proceeding to specialized workstreams.
