# ALL-USE Agent Architecture Mapping

## Overview

This document maps the existing ALL-USE system architecture to the agent-oriented iAI framework, transforming the current modular service-oriented design into an autonomous agent with perception, cognition, action, memory, and learning capabilities.

## 1. Core Agent Architecture Mapping

### Current Architecture
The current ALL-USE system is structured as a modular service-oriented architecture with distinct workstreams:
- Project Orchestration and Command Center
- System Core Setup and Initialization
- Data Pipeline and Management
- Trading Strategy and Execution Engine
- Risk Management and Compliance Framework
- Account Lifecycle Management Watchdogs
- Reporting, Analytics, and Visualization

## 2. Business Logic Mapping

### 2.1 Triple-Account Structure

The unique triple-account structure (Gen-Acc, Rev-Acc, Com-Acc) maps to the agent's goal-oriented behavior system:

**Agent Goals and Subgoals**
- Primary Goal: Generate consistent income and build long-term wealth
- Subgoal 1 (Gen-Acc): Generate high-frequency premium income
- Subgoal 2 (Rev-Acc): Create stable income stream with moderate risk
- Subgoal 3 (Com-Acc): Maximize long-term compounding growth

**Agent Beliefs and Knowledge**
- Account state knowledge
- Market condition beliefs (week-type classification)
- Strategy effectiveness beliefs
- Risk tolerance parameters

### 2.2 Weekly Trading Routine

The weekly trading routine maps to the agent's perception-cognition-action loop:

**Perception-Cognition-Action Loop**
1. **Perception**: Gather market data, account states, and external signals
2. **Cognition**: 
   - Classify week type (Green, Red, or Chop)
   - Select appropriate strategies and parameters
   - Apply ATR Protocol for risk management
3. **Action**:
   - Execute trades according to account-specific strategies
   - Perform mid-week adjustments based on market movements
   - Close positions or roll contracts at appropriate times

### 2.3 Account Lifecycle Management

The account lifecycle management (forking, reinvestment, merging) maps to the agent's long-term planning and execution capabilities:

**Planning and Execution**
- **Quarterly Planning**: Evaluate account performance and apply reinvestment logic
- **Forking Decision-Making**: Trigger account forking when surplus thresholds are met
- **Merging Operations**: Consolidate accounts meeting merge criteria
- **Resource Allocation**: Distribute capital according to account-specific rules

## 3. Integration Points Mapping

### 3.1 STAR-LAB Integration

The STAR-LAB integration maps to the agent's collaboration capabilities:

**Collaboration Interface**
- **Signal Reception**: Process trading signals from STAR-LAB
- **Execution Feedback**: Provide execution status and performance metrics
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Exchange market insights and performance data

### 3.2 Broker Integration

The broker integration maps to the agent's environment interaction capabilities:

**Environment Interaction**
- **Market Operations**: Execute trades through broker API
- **Position Management**: Monitor and adjust positions
- **Account Operations**: Manage account structures and capital allocation

## 4. Data Flow Mapping

### 4.1 Current Data Flow
1. Data Pipeline Services collect and process market data
2. Protocol Engine generates trading signals
3. Order Execution Service processes signals and executes trades
4. Account Lifecycle Management monitors and triggers events
5. Reporting and Analytics generate insights

### 4.2 Agent-Oriented Data Flow
1. **Perception**: Sensory inputs from market, accounts, and external sources
2. **Memory**: Storage and retrieval of relevant experiences and knowledge
3. **Cognition**: Processing of inputs, application of strategies, decision-making
4. **Learning**: Continuous improvement based on outcomes
5. **Action**: Execution of decisions through broker and reporting systems

## 5. Technical Components Mapping

### 5.1 Core Infrastructure

**Agent Configuration**
- Maps to: Configuration Management Service
- Implementation: Agent parameters, beliefs, and behavior settings

**Agent Security**
- Maps to: Secure Secrets Management
- Implementation: Secure credential handling and access control

### 5.2 Data Pipeline

- Implementation: Specialized processors for different data types

**Memory Storage**
- Maps to: Data Validation, Cleaning, and Storage
- Implementation: Vector database for episodic memory, relational database for semantic knowledge

### 5.3 Protocol Engine

**Cognitive Modules**
- Maps to: Trading Strategy Framework, Market Analysis Service
- Implementation: Strategy selection, parameter optimization, risk assessment

**Action Executors**
- Maps to: Order Execution Service, Position Management Service
- Implementation: Trade execution, position adjustment, lifecycle operations

### 5.4 Monitoring and Reporting

**Self-Monitoring**
- Maps to: System Health Monitoring, Performance Metrics
- Implementation: Agent performance tracking, health checks, anomaly detection

## 8. Conclusion

The ALL-USE system is well-suited for transformation into an agent-oriented architecture. Its modular design, rule-based decision making, and feedback loops align naturally with the perception-cognition-action paradigm of the iAI framework. The agent approach will enhance the system's adaptability, learning capabilities, and autonomous operation while maintaining the core business logic of the triple-account structure and trading strategies.
