### Weeks 10-12: Integration and Refinement

**Week 10: Account Lifecycle Management**
- Implement account forking logic
- Create reinvestment operations
- Develop account merging capabilities
- Build capital allocation optimization
- Implement lifecycle event scheduling

**Week 11: Human-Agent and Agent-Agent Collaboration**
- Implement explainable AI capabilities
- Create trust-building communication
- Develop agent communication protocol
- Build shared mental models with STAR-LAB
- Implement collaborative reasoning

**Week 12: Testing, Optimization, and Deployment**
- Conduct comprehensive system testing
- Perform performance optimization
- Develop deployment pipeline
- Create monitoring and alerting system
- Implement final documentation and user guides

## Development Approach

### Closed-Loop Documentation

Each phase will follow the closed-loop documentation approach:

1. **Implementation Prompt**: Detailed requirements and specifications
2. **Implementation**: Code development based on the prompt
3. **Implementation Response**: Documentation of what was implemented, challenges, and future enhancements
4. **Review and Feedback**: Iterative improvement based on feedback

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing**: Test individual components and modules
- **Integration Testing**: Test interactions between components
- **System Testing**: Test end-to-end functionality
- **Simulation Testing**: Test agent behavior in simulated market conditions
- **Performance Testing**: Test system performance under load

### Deployment Strategy

- **Development Environment**: Local Docker-based development
- **Testing Environment**: Cloud-based testing environment
- **Production Environment**: Secure, scalable cloud deployment

## Success Criteria

The ALL-USE Agent implementation will be considered successful when:

1. The agent can autonomously execute the triple-account strategy (Gen-Acc, Rev-Acc, Com-Acc)
2. Week-type classification achieves >80% accuracy in predictive mode
3. The agent can perform account lifecycle operations (forking, reinvestment, merging)
4. The agent demonstrates learning and adaptation to changing market conditions
5. The agent can collaborate effectively with STAR-LAB and human operators
6. All test suites pass with >95% coverage
7. The system meets performance and security requirements

## Risk Management

Potential risks and mitigation strategies:

1. **Market Data Integration Challenges**
   - Mitigation: Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Algorithm Performance Issues**
   - Mitigation: Conduct thorough performance testing and optimization

3. **Broker API Changes**
   - Mitigation: Implement abstraction layer and monitoring for API changes

4. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Mitigation: Incorporate compliance checks and audit trails

5. **System Reliability**
   - Mitigation: Implement redundancy, monitoring, and alerting

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment and repository structure
2. Create detailed implementation prompt for Week 1 (Core Agent Architecture)
3. Begin implementation of the agent foundation
