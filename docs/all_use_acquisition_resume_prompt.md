# ALL-USE Agent Resume Prompt - Acquisition-Focused

## Project Overview

ALL-USE (Automated Lumpsum Leveraged US Equities) is an AI agent that manages a triple-account structure for options trading with specialized strategies. Unlike our other agent projects, ALL-USE is being developed primarily for in-house use for investment and capital growth, though its architecture and documentation should still follow acquisition-ready practices.

## Current Project Status

We have set up the repository structure and created the foundational documentation following the agent-oriented iAI framework. The project is now ready to begin implementation of Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture).

## Acquisition-Focused Development Approach

While ALL-USE is primarily for in-house use, we should maintain acquisition-ready practices:

1. **Technical Excellence**: Focus on the quality and innovation of the triple-account structure and week-type classification algorithms
2. **Demo-Readiness**: Create compelling demonstrations that showcase the unique capabilities
3. **Clean Architecture**: Maintain modular, well-documented code that facilitates potential future due diligence
4. **IP Protection**: Carefully document and protect intellectual property to maximize value

## Key Technical Value Drivers

ALL-USE's estimated tech-only value is $50-70M, driven by:
1. **Triple-Account Structure**: Proprietary algorithms for managing specialized account purposes
2. **Week-Type Classification**: Sophisticated market condition categorization system
3. **Protocol-Based Trading**: Systematic application of strategies based on conditions
4. **Account Lifecycle Management**: Automated forking, reinvestment, and merging

## Documentation Requirements

When resuming development, ensure all work includes:

1. **Technical Architecture Documentation**:
   - Detailed component diagrams showing modular design
   - Clear documentation of proprietary algorithms
   - API specifications for all integration points

2. **Demo Scenario Documentation**:
   - Specific use cases that showcase unique capabilities
   - Step-by-step demo scripts for different scenarios
   - Visual assets for compelling demonstrations

3. **Intellectual Property Inventory**:
   - Catalog of proprietary algorithms and approaches
   - Identification of potential patent opportunities
   - Documentation of competitive advantages

4. **Integration Pathway Documentation**:
   - How ALL-USE could integrate with other systems
   - Estimated integration timelines and resource requirements
   - Potential synergies with other products

## Next Steps

The immediate next steps for the ALL-USE agent project are:

1. **Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture)**:
   - Implement the basic agent structure with perception-cognition-action loop
   - Create the working memory system
   - Develop the LLM integration for the cognitive core
   - Build the initial action framework

2. **Acquisition-Readiness Preparation**:
   - Update all documentation to follow acquisition-focused templates
   - Create compelling demo scenarios
   - Document all intellectual property and innovations
   - Prepare integration guides for potential future systems

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Code Quality**:
   - Maintain modular architecture with clear separation of components
   - Follow consistent coding standards and practices
   - Ensure comprehensive test coverage
   - Provide thorough inline documentation

2. **Demo Development**:
   - Create a dedicated demo environment
   - Develop realistic data sets for demonstrations
   - Script compelling demonstration scenarios
   - Focus on visually impressive and intuitive interfaces

3. **IP Protection**:
   - Document all innovations and proprietary algorithms
   - Maintain clear ownership of all code
   - Carefully manage open-source dependencies and licenses
   - Regularly assess competitive differentiation

## Resuming Development

When resuming development of the ALL-USE agent project, please:

1. Review the project structure and implementation plan documents
2. Check the current status in the todo.md file
3. Examine the architecture mapping and gaps/opportunities documents
4. Continue with the next planned tasks according to the workstream and phase structure
5. Ensure all development follows the acquisition-focused approach outlined in this document

The agent-oriented iAI framework guides all development, with a focus on creating a high-quality system through technical excellence and demo-readiness.
