# ALL-USE Agent Resume Prompt

## Project Status Summary

The ALL-USE Agent project has been initialized with a comprehensive agent-oriented architecture following the iAI framework. The repository has been set up at https://github.com/TKTINC/all_use_agent with foundational documentation, but implementation has not yet begun.

## Current State

1. **Repository Structure**: The repository has been created with the following structure:
   - `/docs/framework/`: Contains architecture mapping, gaps and opportunities, workstreams and phases, and implementation plan
   - `/docs/implementation_responses/`: Ready for implementation documentation
   - `/docs/templates/`: For documentation templates
   - `/src/agent_core/`: Core agent architecture components (perception, cognition, action, memory)
   - `/src/learning_systems/`: For learning and optimization capabilities
   - `/src/trading_systems/`: For trading strategies and execution logic
   - `/tests/`: For test suite

2. **Documentation Completed**:
   - Architecture Mapping: Detailed mapping of current ALL-USE architecture to agent framework
   - Gaps and Opportunities: Analysis of enhancement opportunities through agentification
   - Workstreams and Phases: Structured implementation plan with 6 workstreams and 3 phases each
   - Project Implementation Plan: 12-week roadmap for development
   - Team Onboarding Guide: Comprehensive guide for new team members

3. **Business Logic Preserved**: The unique triple-account structure (Gen-Acc, Rev-Acc, Com-Acc) has been preserved and enhanced as the agent's goal-oriented behavior system.

## Next Steps

The next immediate steps for resuming the project are:

1. **Create Implementation Prompt for Workstream 1, Phase 1 (Core Agent Architecture)**:
   - Define detailed requirements for the basic agent structure with perception-cognition-action loop
   - Specify the agent configuration system and mental model
   - Outline the development of basic working memory for context management
   - Detail the testing framework requirements

2. **Implement Core Agent Architecture**:
   - Set up development environment with necessary dependencies
   - Create the basic agent class structure
   - Implement the perception-cognition-action loop
   - Develop the configuration system
   - Set up basic working memory

3. **Document Implementation**:
   - Create implementation response document detailing what was implemented
   - Update repository with code and documentation
   - Prepare for the next phase (Memory Systems)

## Key Concepts to Remember

1. **Triple-Account Structure**:
   - Gen-Acc (Generator): Weekly ATM wheel strategy (40-50 delta) on high-volatility stocks
   - Rev-Acc (Revenue): Income-stable wheel (30-40 delta OTM) on blue-chip stocks
   - Com-Acc (Compounding): Long-hold compounding engine using shares and LEAPS

2. **Agent Capabilities**:
   - Perception: Monitor market conditions, account states, and external signals
   - Cognition: Analyze market conditions, select strategies, and make trading decisions
   - Action: Execute trades, manage positions, and perform account lifecycle operations
   - Memory: Maintain knowledge of trading history, market patterns, and strategy performance
   - Learning: Improve strategies based on performance and adapt to changing market conditions

3. **Key Agentification Opportunities**:
   - Predictive Week-Type Classification: Transform post-trade analysis into pre-trade prediction
   - Dynamic Strategy Adaptation: Enable more flexible strategy composition
   - Cross-Account Learning: Enable knowledge sharing between account strategies
   - Autonomous Lifecycle Management: Optimize timing of account forking/merging
   - Collaborative Intelligence: Enhance STAR-LAB integration with agent-to-agent communication

## Technical Requirements

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Python 3.10+
   - Docker for containerization
   - Git for version control
   - Vector database for episodic memory (to be selected in Phase 2)
   - Reinforcement learning framework (to be selected in Phase 3)

2. **Testing Framework**:
   - Pytest for unit and integration testing
   - Simulation environment for agent behavior testing

3. **Documentation Approach**:
   - Follow closed-loop documentation with implementation prompts and responses
   - Maintain comprehensive API documentation
   - Update architecture documentation as implementation progresses

## Implementation Workflow

1. Review the current state of the repository and documentation
2. Create the implementation prompt for the next phase
3. Implement the code according to the prompt
4. Document the implementation in an implementation response
5. Commit all changes to the repository
6. Proceed to the next phase

This prompt should provide all necessary context to resume the ALL-USE Agent implementation efficiently.
